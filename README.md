# CARREFOUR-SALES-ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW
As a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya, I am currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). The project has been divided into four parts where I'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various machine learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on the insights. These are the parts of the project: 

### DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION 
In this section, I will be reducing the dimension of the dataset to a low dimension using the dimensionality reduction techniques. The technique used will either be Principal Component Analysis(PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding(t-SNE).

### FEATURE SELECTION 
In this section, I will be selecting the most important features in the provided dataset and thereafter use the selected features to perform analysis and provide insights. The methods that will be used to perform feture selection are embedded methods, wrapper methods and filter methods. 

### ASSOCIATIVE ANALYSIS 
In this section, I will create association rules that will allow identification of relationships between variables in the dataset.

### ANOMALY DETECTION
In this section, I will check if there are any anomalies in the sales data. The objective of this exercise is fraud detection.
